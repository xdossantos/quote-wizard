This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run dev` | Start the development server. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result. |


## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

* [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
* [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying) for more details.

## Packages Used

| Package | Version |
| --- | --- |
| `next` | 15.2.4 |
| `react` | 19.0.0 |
| `react-dom` | 19.0.0 |
| `@types/react` | 19.0.0 |

## Scripts Available

| Script | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `dev` | Start the development server, allowing you to interact with your application and see any changes in real-time. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to start interacting with your app. |
| `build` | Build the application for production, optimizing it for a faster and more secure user experience. This process will generate optimized code and assets that can be used in production environments. |
| `format` | Format the code using Prettier, ensuring consistent coding styles across all files. Any existing formatting will be overwritten with the new settings, making sure your codebase looks clean and readable. |
| `start` | Start the Next.js development server, allowing you to access your application via a local web server. Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to start viewing your site. |
| `lint` | Run ESLint linter checks on all JavaScript files within the project directory. Any errors found will be reported and you can resolve them before proceeding with further development. |
| `e2e` | Start a server, and concurrently run Cypress tests using headless mode to validate that your application is working as expected. This command allows for testing of the entire app in one go.|
| `e2e:headless` | Similar to the previous e2e script but opens Cypress tests in a browser window instead of a separate test environment. |
| `component` | Open the Cypress test file for a selected component, allowing you to browse and view that specific piece of code directly within the Cypress interface. |
| `component:headless` | Runs Cypress test suite with specified components opened as before but without opening an individual browser window for each test file. |
| `test` | Run Jest tests, verifying that all JavaScript files are working correctly as written. This will find and report any errors in your codebase. |
| `test:watch` | Similar to the previous script but instead of stopping when done runs continuously until stopped manually. |
